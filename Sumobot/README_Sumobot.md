An automated robotic system with an Arduino UNO R3 at its core. Automation is achieved through various sensors, in conjunction with an L298N Motor Driver. 

Parts used:

(4) 18650 2200mAh Battery

(2) 1000RPM 12V Motor

(2) HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

(2) TCRT5000 based Line Sensor

(1) L298N Motor Driver

(1) Arduino UNO R3

All electronics and sensors are mounted onto a 10x10 chassis in order to maximize the coverage of the sensors. Do note that the line sensors must be calibrated depeding on the surface it would be operating on.
